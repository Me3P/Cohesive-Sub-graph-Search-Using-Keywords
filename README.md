Decompostion Tree and Subgraph Searching using Keywords!

Keyword search has been widely studied to retrieve relevant substructures from graphs for a given set of keywords. 
However, existing well-studied approaches aim at finding compact trees/subgraphs containing the keywords, and ignore a critical measure, density, to represent how strongly and stably the keyword nodes are connected in the substructure.
Given a set of keywords $Q = \{w_1, w_2,\ldots, w_l\}, we study the problem of finding a cohesive subgraph containing $Q$ with high density and compactness from a graph $G=(V,E)$. 
We model the cohesive subgraph based on a carefully chosen \emph{$k$-truss} model, and formulate the problem of finding cohesive subgraphs for keyword queries as minimal dense truss search problem, i.e., finding minimal subgraph that maximizes the trussness covering $Q$.
